/**
 * Practical exercise instructions.
 * Uncomment the first unit test [hasIOUAmountFieldOfCorrectType()] then run the unit test using the green arrow
 * to the left of the {@link IOUStateTests} class or the [hasIOUAmountFieldOfCorrectType()] method.
 * Running the unit tests from {@link IOUStateTests} runs all of the unit tests defined in the class.
 * The test should fail because you need to make some changes to the IOUState to make the test pass. Read the TODO
 * under each task number for a description and a hint of what you need to do.
 * Once you have the unit test passing, uncomment the next test.
 * Continue until all the unit tests pass.
 * Hint: CMD / Ctrl + click on the brown type names in square brackets for that type's definition in the codebase.
